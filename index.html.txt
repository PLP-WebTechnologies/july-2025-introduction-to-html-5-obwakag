    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine Wet & Dry:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix—it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook Pancakes:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface (about 2-3 minutes), then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve with your favorite toppings!</li>
